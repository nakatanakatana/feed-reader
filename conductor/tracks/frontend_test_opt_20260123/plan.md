# Implementation Plan - Frontend Test Performance Optimization

## Phase 1: Investigation and Profiling
- [x] Task: Measure baseline execution times for all frontend test files. e738228
- [x] Task: Analyze the root causes of slowness in the identified files. f13a67f
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Investigation and Profiling' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Optimization
- [x] Task: Optimize the 1st slowest test file. f13a67f
- [x] Task: Optimize the 2nd slowest test file. f13a67f
- [x] Task: Optimize the 3rd slowest test file (if applicable). f13a67f
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Optimization' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Final Verification
- [x] Task: Execute the full frontend test suite. f13a67f
